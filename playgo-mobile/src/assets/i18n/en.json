In order to allow such campaigns to be carried out, it is necessary to collect and process information related to the tracking of trips made via the App.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">This information is therefore to be considered supplementary to that which will be made available upon joining the various sustainable mobility campaigns proposed over time through the Play&amp;Go App.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">1. PURPOSE OF PROCESSING</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The processing of personal data takes place within the App and will have the following purposes:</span></p><ol class=\"c6 lst-kix_v1j04fyyyjqt-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c5 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">register users and allow them to use the App;</span></li><li class=\"c5 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">ensure the proper functioning of the App;</span></li><li class=\"c5 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">enable the performance, documentation, and improvement of the App&#39;s activities;</span></li><li class=\"c5 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">track and validate trips through the App;</span></li><li class=\"c5 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">provide for scientific, historical, and statistical research purposes.</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">2. OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE DATA</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The legal basis for processing is the explicit consent upon first use of the App.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">All purposes of processing are related to the use of the App. Although there is no obligation to provide the data, failure to do so will make it impossible to proceed with access to the App and therefore to use it. With reference to geolocation, it should be noted that failure to consent to tracking could compromise the validation of your trips.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c7\">3. TYPE OF DATA PROCESSED</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The following categories of data may be processed for the purposes of managing the App: </span></p><ol class=\"c6 lst-kix_4xl5nuom5aqd-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">personal data and contact details;</span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">geolocalization data (data on the user&#39;s position detected in real time, based on the GPS present on the mobile device on which the App is installed, while tracking a trip); </span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">behavior data (mode of travel, number of kilometers covered).</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The user&#39;s public profile data (Google, Facebook, Apple, Smart Community) may be used to personalize the App.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The user&#39;s e-mail address is also used as a means to uniquely identify the user within the Smart Community systems.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c7\">4. METHODS OF DATA PROCESSING</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The processing will be carried out:</span></p><ul class=\"c6 lst-kix_9abvnggic5rt-0 start\"><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">through the App and the use of manual and automated systems;</span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">by individuals authorized and trained to perform such tasks, in accordance with the law; </span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">with the use of appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of data and prevent access to them by unauthorized third parties;</span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">in contexts that do not undermine the personal dignity and decorum of the data subject, ensuring due care to guarantee confidentiality in their use.</span></li></ul><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">You can consult all the technical and organizational measures adopted by FBK to ensure proportionality and necessity of the processing and prevent illegitimate access, unwanted modification, disappearance and explicit breaches of personal data at the following link </span><span class=\"c3 c13 c17\"><a class=\"c15\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/MisureFBK&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1749139687909478&amp;usg=AOvVaw3I2ueLstevB1z71YTAikxC\">bit.ly/MisureFBK</a></span><span class=\"c1\">.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">No automated decision-making process is involved, nor any profiling activity.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">5. DURATION OF TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The data will be retained until the user requests its deletion and, in any case, for a period not exceeding that necessary for the fulfillment the obligations or tasks referred to in point 1, and in any case for pursuing the specific purposes indicated therein. The deletion of the data will occur gradually, based on the exhaustion of the individual purposes for which they were collected.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">In some cases, the data may also be retained after the account is closed, such as in backups or in the Disaster Recovery system, or in aggregated and anonymized form, for scientific research purposes.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c7\">6. COMMUNICATION OF DATA</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The data collected and processed may be communicated exclusively for the above mentioned purposes and in aggregate form, to Public Administrations (for example as promoters of sustainable mobility initiatives).</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Personal data are not subject to dissemination.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">For the exclusive purposes of scientific dissemination of statistical and/or scientific results (e.g., through publication of scientific articles, participation in conferences, etc.), data may be disseminated in anonymous and aggregate form and always in a manner that does not make the Data Subject identifiable.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c7\">7. PLACE OF DATA PROCESSING</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The processing personal data takes place on the territory of the European Union, or with the help of IT tools involving processing in countries for which the European Commission has taken a decision on the adequacy of the protection of personal data or, failing that, through the signing of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for data protection adopted by the European Commission with the supplier.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">8. RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT</span></p><p class=\"c11 c10 c12\"><span class=\"c1\">The Data Subject has the right to ask the Data Controller at any time to exercise the rights set out in Articles 15 et seq. of the GDPR and, in particular, to:</span></p><ul class=\"c6 lst-kix_rh590fh4292s-0 start\"><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">request confirmation of the existence or non-existence of their personal data and request access to them;</span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">obtain information about the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data, the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be communicated and, when possible, the storage period;</span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">obtain rectification and deletion of data;</span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">obtain restriction of processing; </span></li><li class=\"c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c1\">object to the processing at any time.</span></li></ul><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">He or she also has the right to revoke his consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent given before revocation. </span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c7\">To exercise the above rights, please write to: </span><span class=\"c7 c10 c13\"><a class=\"c15\" href=\"mailto:privacy@fbk.eu\">privacy@fbk.eu</a></span><span class=\"c7 c10\">.</span><span class=\"c7\">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">This is without prejudice to the right to send a complaint to the Garante per la protezione dei dati personali.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">9. DATA CONTROLLER</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The data controller for the processing of personal data is the Bruno Kessler Foundation, based in Trento, Italy</span><span class=\"c1\">, via Santa Croce, 77 &ndash; +39.0461.314.621-227 &ndash; segr.presidenza@fbk.eu</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">10. CONTACT DETAILS OF THE DATA PROTECTION OFFICER </span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">The Data Controller has designated a Data Protection Officer (DPO) pursuant to Article 37 of the GDPR, who can be contacted through the following channels</span><span class=\"c1\">: +39.0461.314.370 &ndash; privacy@fbk.eu.</span></p><p class=\"c2 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">11.
